# Anime Analysis in R

MyAnimeList (https://myanimelist.net/), often abbreviated as MAL, is an anime and manga social networking and social cataloging application website. The site provides its users with a list-like system to organize and score anime and manga. It facilitates finding users who share similar tastes and provides a large database of anime and manga.

Problem Statement: Anime without rankings or popularity scores were excluded. Producers, genre, and studio were converted from lists to tidy observations, so there will be repetitions of shows with multiple producers, genres, etc.

Implementation: This development has been carried out to analyze the various factors that influence the popularity or rank of a particular anime. The data was cleaned and shaped accordingly to carry out the analysis and infer the results.
